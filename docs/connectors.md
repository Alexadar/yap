## API management
API management is the process of creating and publishing web application programming interfaces (APIs), enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing subscriber communities, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting performance.
API Management helps organizations to publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. Businesses everywhere are looking to extend their operations as a digital platform, creating new channels, finding new customers and driving deeper engagement with existing ones. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection.

## Integration challenges
The average enterprise uses over 200 different applications – both cloud-based and on-premise – they are personal and business productivity programs with key part of daily work and data. Such applications are often not integrated with other business data.
Without automated integration, organizations cannot leverage the full power of data in multiple applications, for example, to re-enter data in applications or constantly switch context across applications to accomplish tasks.
Automated integration solves the problem of data silos and manual workflows. But if you are going to automate transactions that span applications, these processes must be reliable, secure, and manageable. 
Business and IT users need visibility into the running integrations and the capability to take appropriate action if an error or exception occurs.
The integration solution must be able to handle the complexities of real-world problems. The integration problems often require more than just transporting single data objects across applications.
The most common issues with integration solutions today are the following:
Powerful integration products are focused on technical users, while citizen integrator products sacrifice usability.
Citizen integrator products need to be enterprise-grade in terms of reliability, scalability, and security.
Adding new complex integrations can involve long implementation (spanning months), while new apps are coming online much faster.
Integration platform products are relatively expensive, sometimes costing more than connected applications.
IT needs visibility for integration processes. Where necessary, IT and business users should collaborate to create and manage integration solutions.
YAP addresses these issues with an enterprise-class integration tool, which can be governed and monitored by IT, providing the ease of use and low barrier to entry, which is expected from client applications.

## Enterprise-grade foundation
The YAP platform has a powerful feature set to handle real-world problems, including integration of applications, data, and people. 
YAP combines the enterprise-grade workflow automation platform and ease of use expected from client apps supporting both cloud-based and on-premise systems. 
YAP runtime system is designed for security, robustness, reliability, and high performance.

## Citizen integrator
YAP is the only integration platform that was built from the ground to support a single design interface for developer/IT and for citizen integrators.
Citizen integrators are designed for those who would like to integrate applications quickly but isn’t deeply technical. 
YAP ensures that citizens and IT have access to the same easy-to-use driven productivity improvements, as well as offers citizens advanced power and capability available to IT.

## IT governance
Governance is a key requirement for any platform that allows business users to work with corporate data. 
YAP is a management tool that provides cross-enterprise visibility into users, usage, integration processes, and the applications that users connect. 
YAP supports assigning differing levels of responsibility and visibility within the platform, enabling collaboration between business and IT users.
